        <p>what is the longest lasting man made institution ever created?</p>
        <br>
        <p>religions.</p>
        <br>
        <p>so the idea is, along with whatever markers are chosen, to create what is essentially</p>
        <p style="font-size: xx-large;">a nuclear cult.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="final">
        <p>a few additional plans, that would be used in conjunction with The Atomic Priesthood would be others that
            exploit "cultural memory"</p>
        <p>one particularly strange plan, is to</p>
        <p style="font-size: xx-large;">genetically engineer cats to glow in the presence of deadly radiation</p>
        <p>they even made a song about them.</p>

        <p>so, why is it that this is a problem that even needs solving?</p>
        <p>a majority of our waste is spend nuclear fuel from reactors, the rest is leftover from the creation of
            nuclear warheads.</p>
        <p>I am not going to tell you whether or not these technologies are good or bad, but regardless, we have this
            waste, and we need to deal with it.</p>
        <p>at the moment, there are a limited number of things we can even do with spend fuel,</p>
        <p>some contries, such as France, recycle their spend fuel rods, however this just creates denser, and more
            dangerous waste in the end</p>
        <p>and, we can store it, and just</p>
        <p>wait.</p>
        <p>as stated before, these waste products will continue to be dangerous for 10,000 years.</p>
        <p>so what are we going to do?</p>
